# hello, world!

tl;dr: I'm a random person who will write random-seeming posts.

First and foremost, thank you for being here! I hope you will come to find this blog's content interesting.

Second, if you would like to know more about me, please head over to the [about section](https://leopold.lt/about/).

Now, it has been more than a few years since I have had the thought of a personal blog. I do not know whether the idea was even mine in the first place or whether my brother was the one who brought it up, but it was the inspiration from another random person, [Justin](https://glibert.io/), that led me to actually start one.

This blog will serve as a place where I attempt to clearly lay down what I have in mind.

As I currently see things, there may not be a strong consistency in the topics I choose, beyond the fact that they will all have gone through my _[careenium](https://jsomers.net/careenium.pdf)_. Nonetheless, it is likely that a given post will fall under one of two categories. On the one hand there will be posts about some technical matter that I find interesting and may have worked on; and on the other hand will be the presentation of thoughts or ideas I would like to discuss. The latter category will be comparable to short essays.

Furthermore, I will not post on a particularly regular basis, though as a ballpark it may be about once per month—meaning I will unlikely post either ten times less or ten times more often than that.

Finally, it is important that I restate the following. This blog's primary aim is that I structure my thoughts—for its own sake. At least initially, that will be my internal motivation. Posting into the blue, without even knowing if anyone else is reading, will alone be a drive for rigor. However, should I eventually get a readership, feedback and criticism will always be welcomed and will doubtlessly further sharpen my work.

It is with a smile that I end this first post.

Thank you,

LT
