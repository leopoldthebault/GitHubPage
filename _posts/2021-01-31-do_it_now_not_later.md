title: do it now, not later.
---

Why? Because my grandmother said so.


'Why?,' you insist? Because if you do it now you won't have to do it later.

'But I don't want to do it now.' And so you expect you'll want to do it later? If you know you will and that's a better use of your time then go for it. If not, then that's precisely why. If you do it now you can do something more valuable later. You claim you're always bored. Well, do it now and move on with things. You'll get more done in the end, and will literally live more.

What if you postpone it and never get to it in the end? That often happens. You constantly put it off, feel sorry for yourself in doing so, and end up not doing it. This is an incredible waste of energy which creates useless anxiety which has a significant though intangible effect on your daily life. You'll also gain the wisdom to know what's worth doing and what's not â€“ an invaluable skill.

Also do things right the first time, it'll avoid you having to fix what you've done down the line.


When you start doing things now you begin to understand yourself as someone who is reliable, giving yourself the gift of integrity and self-respect.
