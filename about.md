## Hola!

I'm Leopold, and am a rising senior in [Electrical & Mechanical Engineering](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/undergraduate/degrees/index.php?action=programme&code=HHH6) at the University of Edinburgh—pronounced ˈɛdɪnbərə, in case you were wondering!
I've just come back from an unforgettable and formative year studying abroad, and am now working at new skills I want to learn over summer.

## Where I'm at
* I'm nearly done with a linear algebra course taught through MIT's [OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/). What I learned on the topic during my first term at university was not enough for what I'd like to do in programming, so building a more solid foundation seemed essential.
* As soon as I'm done with this I'll head in one of many directions—or maybe many directions at once. My first aim is to publish \[on this website] a post on my implementation of a robot navigation problem from a paper on real time optimization that I carried out last May for school. From there I hope to build on the robot navigation program to make it both more robust and more capable. I also will spend my free time learning about robotics.
* I'm actively looking for a co-op/placement in robotics or related domains from the start of 2020 (from Jan/Feb through Jun/Jul). I'm very excited for this, and can't wait to see where this takes me! For those interested, here are a [CV](https://www.visualcv.com/leopold-t/) and my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/leopold-t).
