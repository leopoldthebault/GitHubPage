# Hi there,

I'm **Leopold**, and am a rising senior in **[Electrical & Mechanical Engineering](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/undergraduate/degrees/index.php?action=programme&code=HHH6)** at the University of Edinburgh. I've just come back from an incredibly formative year studying abroad, and have now been working at new skills over summer.

Here's a little more about myself.

# üõ∞Ô∏è Where I'm at
* I'm currently learning robotics through **[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)**'s **[Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics)**, a semester-long course taught at **Northwestern**.

* Besides the above, I will generally be studying towards a better understanding of **control and optimization** problems.

* I'm actively looking for a **co-op/placement** in robotics or related domains from the start of 2020 (from Jan/Feb through Jun/Jul). For anyone interested, please have a look at my **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leopold-t/)** and **[CV](https://www.visualcv.com/leopold-t/)**.

* I've also been reading a fair amount lately, inspired by my friend **[Justin](https://glibert.io/)**. I recently finished **Antifragile** by Nassim Taleb, and am onto **G√∂del, Escher, Bach** by Douglas Hofstadter, among other works.

# üåå Where I come from

* I spent last year at **[Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/)**, which was an unforgettable experience. Academically, it was both the most difficult and rewarding time of my life.

* Another _very_ significant experience I've had thus far in my university years was being part of **[HYPED](https://hyp-ed.com/)**, _The University of Edinburgh [Hyperloop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop) Team_. I joined in fall of my first year, the year our team made it for the first time as finalists in **SpaceX**'s **[Hyperloop Pod Competition](https://www.spacex.com/hyperloop)**; and by the end of the year I had CADed the chassis, found a manufacturer for it, and remotely led the bodywork design manufacturing while being in Germany for an internship. The following year, as a sophomore, I led a \[sub]team of about 20 students from freshman through Masters' to develop a modular design for our new pod prototype, all built from handlaid carbon fiber, with materials I had obtained through in-kind donations. That year we made it to the finals once more, and landed **6th overall** (it's worth noting that the finals include around 20 teams from over 1000 initial applicants).

# üîÆ _What else?_

*I was born in **New York**, moved to **Barcelona** when I was seven, and moved to **Paris** five years after that. I then spent a year in‚Äîand graduated high school from‚Äî**Shanghai**. Upon graduation I moved to **Edinburgh** for university, went to **Pasadena** (near Los Angeles) to study abroad, and am now headed back to Edinburgh but for a term before I move anew since I plan to carry my placement out abroad.

* A result of living many places is that I speak **French**, **English**, and **Spanish** natively. I can conversationally pick up Catalan in the space of a couple of minutes, and completed the Duolingo course in Portuguese, for what that's worth. I also took **Chinese** for five years, which I was lucky enough to practice a fair amount while in Shanghai.

* I really like kitesurfing and other things. I also like design.
