# Hi there,

I'm **Leopold**, and am a Master's student in **[Electrical & Mechanical Engineering](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/undergraduate/degrees/index.php?action=programme&code=HHH6)** at the University of Edinburgh.

Here's a little more about myself.

* I've undertook a 7 month co-op at **[SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/)** from January through July 2020 as a **Launch Intern**. During my time there I owned 9 projects in support of the Falcon 9, Dragon, and Starlink businesses. For anyone interested in my experience, feel free to have a look at my **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leopold-t/)** and **[CV](https://www.visualcv.com/leopold-t/)**.

* I undertook a year-long exchange at **[Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/)**, which was an unforgettable experience. Academically, it was both the most difficult and rewarding time of my life.

* Earlier in my studies I was also a part of **[HYPED](https://hyp-ed.com/)**, _The University of Edinburgh [Hyperloop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop) Team_. I joined in fall of my first year, the year our team made it for the first time as finalists in **SpaceX**'s **[Hyperloop Pod Competition](https://www.spacex.com/hyperloop)**; and by the end of the year I had CADed the chassis, found a manufacturer for it, and remotely led the bodywork design manufacturing while being in Germany for an internship.

* The following year, as a sophomore, I led a \[sub]team of about 20 students from freshman through Masters' to develop a modular design for our new pod prototype, all built from handlaid carbon fiber, with materials I had obtained through in-kind donations. That year we made it to the finals once more, and landed **6th overall** (it's worth noting that the finals include around 20 teams from over 1000 initial applicants).
