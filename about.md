# Hola!

I'm **Leopold**, and am a rising senior in **[Electrical & Mechanical Engineering](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/undergraduate/degrees/index.php?action=programme&code=HHH6)** at the University of Edinburgh‚Äîpronounced _Àà…õd…™nb…ôr…ô_, in case you were wondering! I've just come back from an incredibly formative year studying abroad, and am now working at new skills I want to learn over summer.

Here's a little more about myself.

# üõ∞Ô∏è Where I'm at
* I'm nearly done with a **linear algebra** course taught through **MIT**'s **[OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)**. What I learned on the topic during my first term at university was not enough for what I'd like to do in programming, so building a more solid foundation seemed essential.

* As soon as I'm done with this I'll head in one of many directions‚Äîor maybe many directions at once. My first aim is to publish (on this website) a post on my implementation of a **robot navigation problem** from a paper on real time optimization that I carried out last May for school. From there I hope to build on the robot navigation program to make it both more robust and more capable.

* I'm actively looking for a **co-op/placement** in robotics or related domains from the start of 2020 (from Jan/Feb through Jun/Jul). I'm very excited for this, and can't wait to see where it takes me! For those interested, here are my **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leopold-t/)** and **[CV](https://www.visualcv.com/leopold-t/)**.

* I've also been reading a fair amount lately, inspired by my friend **[Justin](https://glibert.io/)** who reads more than anyone else I know‚Äîand I don't only know engineers. While I'm at it, it's thanks to him that I'm writing this website in the first place, so do check him out. I recently finished **Antifragile** by Nassim Taleb, and am onto **G√∂del, Escher, Bach** by Douglas Hofstadter, among other works.

# üåå Where I come from
_Where __do__ I come from?_

* I spent last year at **[Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/)**, which was an unforgettable experience. Academically, it was both the most difficult and rewarding time of my life. In theory, I learned a lot; so did I in practice. \[Please note the previous sentence is both a true statement and a joke; fully one and the other.] Going into this year I ~~thought~~ knew that I was destined for materials science. I took a first course on the topic‚Äîloved it! I took a second course‚Äîdropped it. It's such an interesting discipline, yet I came to realize it isn't for me. Now, as you know, I'm looking forward to what I have to learn in robotics!

* Another _very_ significant experience I've had thus far in my university years was being part of **[HYPED](https://hyp-ed.com/)**, _The University of Edinburgh [Hyperloop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop) Team_. I joined in fall of my first year, not knowing in the slightest what I'd bring to the team besides enthusiasm and an inherent ability to do general human things. That year our team made it for the first time as finalists in **SpaceX**'s **[Hyperloop Pod Competition](https://www.spacex.com/hyperloop)**; and by the end of the year I had CADed the chassis, found a manufacturer for it, and remotely led the bodywork design manufacturing while being in Germany for an internship. The following year, as a sophomore, I led a \[sub]team of about 20 students from freshman through Masters' to develop a modular design for our new pod prototype, all built from handlaid carbon fiber, with materials I had obtained through in-kind donations. That year we made it to the finals once more, and landed **6th overall** (it's worth noting that the finals include around 20 teams from over 1000 initial applicants).

* For a more literal answer to the question posed at the start of this section: I don't quite know. I _would_ say though, _je me sens plut√¥t fran√ßais._

# üîÆ _Mais encore?_
I do hope this French is not _too_ detracting.

* Put simply, I was born in **New York**, moved to **Barcelona** when I was seven, and moved to **Paris** five years after that. Then, because my parents figured I would enjoy moving once more for my senior year, I spent a year in‚Äîand graduated high school from‚Äî**Shanghai**. And yes, I did enjoy it. Very much so. Then, as you may have inferred, I moved to **Edinburgh** for university, went to **Pasadena** (near Los Angeles) to study abroad, and am now headed back to Edinburgh but for a term before I move anew since I plan to carry my placement out abroad! Yes, I like moving.

* From living in so many places, a nice side-effect is that I speak **French**, **English**, and **Spanish** natively, can conversationally pick up Catalan (since I've formally learned it) in the space of a couple of minutes, and completed the Duolingo course in Portuguese, for what that's worth. I also took **Chinese** for five years, which I was lucky enough to practice a fair amount while in Shanghai. Needless to say, moving around this much has endowed me with a fair cultural understanding and appreciation for what makes us different, and, at a deeper level, alike.

* I really like kitesurfing and other things. I also like design.
