## Hola!

I'm Leopold, and am a rising senior in [Electrical & Mechanical Engineering](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/undergraduate/degrees/index.php?action=programme&code=HHH6) at the University of Edinburgh—pronounced ˈɛdɪnbərə, in case you were wondering!
I've just come back from an unforgettable and formative year studying abroad, and am now working at new skills I want to learn over summer.
