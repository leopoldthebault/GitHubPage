## Hola!

I'm Leopold, and am a rising senior in [Electrical & Mechanical Engineering](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/undergraduate/degrees/index.php?action=programme&code=HHH6) at the University of Edinburgh—pronounced _ˈɛdɪnbərə_, in case you were wondering!
I've just come back from an unforgettable and formative year studying abroad, and am now working at new skills I want to learn over summer.

## Where I'm at
* I'm nearly done with a **linear algebra** course taught through MIT's [OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/). What I learned on the topic during my first term at university was not enough for what I'd like to do in programming, so building a more solid foundation seemed essential.

* As soon as I'm done with this I'll head in one of many directions—or maybe many directions at once. My first aim is to publish \[on this website] a post on my implementation of a **robot navigation problem** from a paper on real time optimization that I carried out last May for school. From there I hope to build on the robot navigation program to make it both more robust and more capable. I also will spend my free time learning about robotics.

* I'm actively looking for a **co-op/placement** in robotics or related domains from the start of 2020 (from Jan/Feb through Jun/Jul). I'm very excited for this, and can't wait to see where this takes me! For those interested, here are a [CV](https://www.visualcv.com/leopold-t/) and my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/leopold-t).

## Where I come from
_Where __do__ I come from?_

* I spent last year at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/), which was an incredible experience. Academically, it was both the most difficult and rewarding time of my life. In theory, I learned a lot; so did I in practice. \[Please note the previous sentence is both a true statement and a joke; fully one and the other.] Going into this year I ~~thought~~ knew that I was destined for materials science. I took a first course on the topic—loved it! I took a second course—dropped it. It's such an interesting discipline, but from one thing to the next, I realized it wasn't for me. Now, as you know, I'm looking forward to what I have to learn in robotics!

* Another _very_ significant experience I've had thus far in my university years was being part of [HYPED](https://hyp-ed.com/), _The University of Edinburgh Hyperloop Team_ \[see [Hyperloop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop)]. I joined in fall of my first year, not knowing in the slightest what I'd bring to the team, besides enthusiasm and an inherent ability to do general human things. That year our team made it for the first time as finalists in SpaceX's [Hyperloop Pod Competition](https://www.spacex.com/hyperloop); and by the end of the year I had CADed the chassis, found a manufacturer for it, and remotely led the bodywork design manufacturing while being in Germany for an internship. The following year, as a sophomore, I led a \[sub]team of about 20 students from freshman through Masters' to develop a modular design for our new pod prototype, all built from handlaid carbon fiber, with materials I had obtained through in-kind donations.

* For a more literal answer to the question posed at the start of this section: I don't quite know. I _would_ say though, _je me sens plutôt français._

## _Mais encore?_
I do hope this French is not too detracting.

* Put simply, I was born in New York, moved to Barcelona when I was seven, and moved to Paris five years after that. Then, because my parents figured it would be best for me not to spend my senior year with friends I'd made over the course of half a decade,
